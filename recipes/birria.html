    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 lbs beef or goat meat (bone-in for richer flavor)</li>
        <li>5 dried guajillo chilies</li>
        <li>3 dried ancho chilies</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Corn tortillas, lime wedges, chopped onions, and fresh cilantro for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Remove stems and seeds from dried chilies. Toast them lightly in a dry skillet,
            then soak them in hot water for about 15 minutes.
        </li>

        <li>
            In a blender, combine soaked chilies, chopped onion, minced garlic, oregano, cumin, cloves, salt, and pepper.
            Blend until smooth, adding water if needed to achieve a pourable consistency.
        </li>

        <li>
            Cut the meat into large chunks and place them in a large pot. Pour the chili mixture over the meat, 
            ensuring it's fully coated. Marinate for at least 1 hour, preferably overnight.
        </li>

        <li>
            Add enough water to the pot to cover the meat. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer, 
            covered, for 2-3 hours or until the meat is tender and falls apart easily.
        </li>

        <li>
            Once the meat is cooked, remove it from the pot and shred it using two forks.
            Skim any excess fat from the broth.
        </li>

        <li>
            Serve the shredded meat with warm corn tortillas, lime wedges, chopped onions, 
            fresh cilantro, and a bowl of the flavorful broth for dipping or as a soup. 
            Enjoy the rich, aromatic flavors of this classic Mexican dish!
